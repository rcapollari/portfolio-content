        The Pistons have 3 NBA championships, which they won in 1989, 1990, and
        2004. Only 8 NBA franchises have 3 or more championships. The Pistons'
        first two titles were won off the backs of the self-proclaimed "Bad
        Boys," a team that played hard-nosed defense and weren't afraid to get
        physical. They were led by a hall-of-fame backcourt with Isiah Thomas
        and Joe Dumars. Rick Mahorn and Bill Laimbeer were the enforcers in the
        frontcourt, and Dennis Rodman was the pest on the boards. This team is
        highly credited with ending the Los Angeles Lakers' dynasty of the
        1980s.

        2004 was the year of the "Going to Work" Pistons team that embodied the
        same defensive prowess of the Pistons championship teams of the past.
        This team was special because none of their players had ever made an
        all-star game up to that point. Led by coach Larry Brown, a starting
        lineup of Chauncey Billups, Richard "Rip" Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince,
        Rasheed Wallace, and Ben Wallace took the NBA by storm when they beat
        the powerhouse Los Angeles Lakers once again in the NBA Finals. The
        Lakers, who were led by future hall-of-famers Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
        Bryant, were heavily favored to win this series. Instead the Pistons
        took the trophy home within 5 games of a 7-game series.
