        As the current Detroit Pistons look to the future, they have been
        working to rebuild their roster through the NBA Draft, a process where
        young college and international players are selected to play for their
        team. The rebuild process started in 2020, when General Manager Troy
        Weaver selected Killian Hayes, Saddiq Bey, Isiah Stewart, and Saben Lee
        with his picks in the Draft. In 2021, the Pistons were fortunate to
        receive the first pick in the Draft which they used on Oklahoma State
        University guard, Cade Cunningham. That same year they also selected
        Michigan's Isaiah Livers, Iowa's Luka Garza, and Florida State's Balsa
        Koprivica. Only Livers and Cunningham remain with the team. In 2022, the
        Pistons selected Purdue's Jaden Ivey with the 5th pick and traded up to
        get Memphis center Jalen Duren. There is a lot of hope that these young
        men will help lead the charge and put the Pistons back in the Playoff
        hunt.

        If we look at the Pistons' past draft picks, some turned out very well
        while others we might wish to forget about. Maybe the most infamous
        Pistons draft pick of all time was one many fans wish they could forget.
        In 2003, the Pistons selected European forward Darko Milicic with the
        2nd pick. In this same draft, future hall-of-famers Dwyane Wade, Carmelo
        Anthony, and Chris Bosh were selected immediately after. Of course, not
        every pick has been bad. In the 1981 draft with the second pick, the
        Pistons selected the legendary Isiah Thomas. Dennis Rodman and Joe
        Dumars were also selected by the Pistons. In more recent years, back in
        2012 the Pistons took Andre Drummond with the 9th and he turned into one
        of the most dominant rebounders in the team's history. As the team looks
        to build success into the future, they will need to get back to the
        formula that allowed them to draft such special players.
