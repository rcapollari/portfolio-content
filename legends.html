      <h1>Legends</h1>
      <p>
        There have been many legendary players that have worn a Pistons uniform
        in the team's storied past. The franchise has retired nine players'
        numbers, meaning that those numbers can never be worn again by another
        player on the team. Chauncey Billups, Ben Wallace, Joe Dumars, Dennis
        Rodman, Isiah Thomas, Vinnie Johnson, Bob Lanier, Dave Bing, and Bill
        Laimbeer have all had their numbers retired by the team (Source:
        <a href="https://hoopshabit.com/detroit-pistons/" target="_blank"
          >Fansided</a
        >). These players were all instrumental in the success of the team and
        were extremely talented basketball players. To have a number retired is
        a big honor in professional sports.

        In addition to players, the Pistons have also had some legendary coaches
        in their time. Chuck Daly led the Bad Boys teams to back-to-back
        championships in 1989 and 1990. He also has the number 2 retired in his
        honor. Larry Brown coached the team for 3 seasons, leading the pistons
        to their third championship in 2004. The Pistons have had other very
        successful coaches such as Rick Carlisle, Stan Van Gundy, and Dwane
        Casey.
